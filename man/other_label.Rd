\title{Automatically assign "other" to low observation count grouping values}
\usage{
other_label(df, column, percentile = 0.9, custom = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The dataframe to be manipulated}

\item{column}{Which column to relabel}

\item{percentile}{Which percentage to cut off the data at}

\item{custom}{A custom vector of values to reassign to "other" in the dataset}
}
\value{
The dataframe with reassigned column
}
\description{
Often times, a dataset will have groups which are distributed
somewhat exponentially - almost all rows fall into a few group values, but there are many smaller group values for
the remaining observations. For example, you may have a dataset with employee level observations and want to use
"US State" as a group, but 90\% of the observations fall into New York, California, Texas, and perhaps 6 other states.
All remaining observations are distributed amongst the remaining 41 states, but you might prefer to lump all of those
observations into a single bucket. This functions provides a way to reassign all those observations to "other".
