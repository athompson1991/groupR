Description: In a business setting, there can be a number of demands for a particular "break-out" of data.
    This package is designed to comprehensively work through every single combination of data breakouts based on the particular format the data comes in.
    The groupings are defined, a function is applied, and a structured list of results is returned which aggregates the data with the given function.
    A number of time series functions are available as well to facilitate analysis and even forecasting.
